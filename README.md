Afterwards, print the following to the console.</br>

In 2015, a person with __________ earned an average of __________/year.</br>
Fill in the blanks with the type of education and the expected average salary. Make sure to use correct grammar in your printed statement. For help, refer to the findings above.</br>

In 2015, a person with a Bachelor's degree earned an average of $59,124/year.</br>
TIP: To print out the average salary with commas (i.e. 59,124), use the toLocaleString() method and pass it the locale "en-US". For example, salary.toLocaleString("en-US").</br>
TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

If education equals "an Associate's degree", then In 2015, a person with an Associate's degree earned an average of $41,496/year. should be printed to the console.
